About:

This repository / Github Pages site includes packaged dists of things to avoid
certain problems on CPAN, in order to simply get the gears moving so that you
can test dependents of these modules on various platforms without being hedged
in by a failure.

Installing them should be as simple as:

  cpanm $PATH_TO_URI_LISTED

Layout is as follows:

  <purpose>/
    <Dist-Name>/
      <SIZE> - <Dist-Name>-<VERSION>.tar.gz
        <number>-<patchdescription>.patch

Where patches are applied patches where relevant.

Warranty/Copyright:

No warranty implied, these are strictly for integration testing of dependents.

Copyrights are all deferred to individual packages. See inside for details.
